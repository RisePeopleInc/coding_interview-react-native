# Rise Coding Interview - React Native

## Welcome!

In the next hour, we'd like to see you build a small React Native app from scratch. At the end of our time together, we should have a mobile app that can run in the Android simulator.

This is a paired, "open-book" coding assessment. We'd like you to share your screen and have your camera on.

### üëç You may:
- Google for API or syntax, search for how-tos and examples
- Use AI coding tools and IDEs (we'd love to hear why you like the tools you use)
- Use open-source libraries and frameworks
- Ask us for clarification

### üôÖ You may not:
- Re-use old work
- Get help from another individual

### üèÅ To begin:
- Clone this repo and create a branch
- Select a framework (or don't). Be prepared to explain your choices.
- Select a UI framework (or don't). Be prepared to explain your choices.
- Include unit testing with Jest. We're not looking for 100% coverage, but we'd like to see your approach to testing.

### üìã Your app should:
- Display a splash screen with the Rise Logo
- Start with an unauthenticated screen that prompts users to log in with a username and password.
- Once authenticated, your app should display three tabs:
  - HomeTab:
    - Card with decoded JWT token, displaying `user_email` at top
    - Have a card that shows current GPS location
  - Empty Tab
    - It should be empty!
  - Profile Tab
    - Display additional information returned from this API end point
      - A card with user's name and title
      - A working log-out button
      - Button to enrol biometrics
