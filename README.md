# Rise Coding Interview - React Native

## Welcome!

In the next hour, we'd like to see you build a small React Native app from scratch. At the end of our time together, we should have a mobile app that can run in the Android simulator.

This is a paired, "open-book" coding assessment. We'd like you to share your screen and have your camera on.

### üëç You may:
- Google for API or syntax, search for how-tos and examples
- Use AI coding tools and IDEs (we'd love to hear why you like the tools you use)
- Use open-source libraries and frameworks
- Ask us for clarification

### üôÖ You may <ins>not</ins>:
- Re-use old work
- Get help from another individual

### üèÅ To begin:
- Clone this repo and create a branch
- Select a framework (or don't). Be prepared to explain your choices.
- Select a UI framework (or don't). Be prepared to explain your choices.
- Our Coding Standards include unit testing with Jest. We're not looking for 100% coverage, but we'd like to see your approach to testing.

### Tech Prerequisites: 
The app will need to be able to perform / interact with the following :
- Public API endpoints that require no authentication.
- Public API endpoints that require JWT token.
- Device's GPS data.
- Biometric data.

### üìã Your app should:
- Display a splash screen with the Rise Logo
- Start with an unauthenticated screen that prompts users to log in with a username and password. The API (token) response will be used throughout the app.
- Once authenticated, your app should have a layout that has a Tabs at the bottom of the screen:
  - HomeTab(Initial Tab) - A screen with Two Cards:
    - a Card with decoded JWT token information where the CardTitle displays the `user_email` at top, and the content shows the `uta` payload.
    - a Card with a GPS payload from the device.
  - Empty Tab
    - A screen that shows no content.
  - Profile Tab
    - Display additional information returned from the `Employeees` API end point
      - A card with user's name and title
      - A working log-out button
      - Button to enrol biometrics

## APIs:

### Test Credentials
- id: `j.d.@example.com`
- password: `FakePassword1`

---

### üìò Login API:  POST `/tokens/with_refresh_token`

Authenticate a user and retrieve an access token and refresh token for subsequent authorized requests.

---

#### üìç **Endpoint**

```
https://gateway-test.risepeople.com/tokens/with_refresh_token
```

---

#### üì• **Headers**

| Header           | Value               | Description                              |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Accept`         | `application/json`  | Client expects a JSON response           |
| `Content-Type`   | `application/json`  | Request body is formatted as JSON        |

---

#### üßæ **Request Body**

Send a JSON object containing the user‚Äôs credentials:

```json
{
  "email": "j.d@example.com",
  "password": "FakePassword1",
  "realm": "rise"
}
```

#### Field Descriptions:

| Field      | Type     | Description                                  |
|------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `email`    | string   | The user's email address                     |
| `password` | string   | The user's password (in plain text)          |
| `realm`    | string   | The realm or tenant (e.g., `"rise"`)         |

---

#### üì§ **Expected Response**

```json
{
  "auth_token": "string",
  "refresh_token": "string"
}
```

#### Response Field Descriptions:

| Field            | Type     | Description                               |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `auth_token`     | string   | Token to be used in authenticated requests|
| `refresh_token`  | string   | Token used to refresh the access token    |

---

#### üîí **Security Notes**
- This endpoint transmits **sensitive credentials**, so ensure the request is made over **HTTPS**.
- Do not expose the `password`, `access_token`, or `refresh_token` to the UI.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Use Cases**

- Logging in a user via CLI or script
- Backend service authentication
- Testing login functionality with credentials
